# Purpose:
This tool is designed to help protect games and applications from tampering and hacking by modifying in-memory data. It works by accessing the virtual memory addresses of running processes, checking for ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), and modifying memory values based on certain conditions. This can be useful for securing applications against unwanted modifications.

# Features:
Detects whether ASLR is active in the application.
Calculates the actual memory address considering ASLR.
Modifies memory values in running processes based on 32-bit or 16-bit data.
Temporarily changes memory protection to allow reading and writing.
Warning:
This tool should be used with caution. Improper use can lead to unintended system behavior or application crashes. It is intended for personal, educational use and should not be used for malicious purposes.
